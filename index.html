                    A non-governmental organization, or NGO, is a group of individuals who come together to form an
                    organization that addresses social, economic,
                    political, and environmental issues and supports those in need. NGOs are not part of the government
                    and operate independently.
                    They can be regional, national, or international, depending on their objectives.
                    Most NGOs are non-profit organizations and receive funds from individuals or entities interested in
                    their activities.
                    Due to their role, many governments consider NGOs necessary and support their activities.
                    The objectives of NGOs can be social, economic, political, or environmental, and their functions
                    include providing aid, working with the government,
                    advocating for rights, providing training, raising awareness, and garnering mass support.
                    Overall, NGOs play an important role in society by addressing issues that governments and businesses
                    may not be able to address effectively,
                    and ensuring equal representation of all communities.

                <p>
                    Turkey and northern Syria have been hit by two powerful earthquakes in quick succession, resulting
                    in devastating consequences.
                    Tragically, the quakes have claimed the lives of over 37,000 people, including thousands of
                    children, and left nearly 100,000 injured.
                    Urgent assistance is needed to provide relief to the thousands of survivors, including many children
                    and babies who are stranded in harsh winter conditions
                    without shelter or warmth.

                            IHH has been working since 1992 with the purpose of delivering aid to all people who are in
                            need,
                            who have experienced a catastrophe, who are victims of war, natural disaster, etc. or
                            wounded, crippled, starved,
                            homeless and persecuted, wherever they are, regardless of their religion, language, race or
                            sect, and to prevent the violation of the basic
                            human rights and freedoms of those people.
                            IHH's voluntary relief activities evolved into an official organization in 1995 and spread
                            around five continents
                            as it established a bridge of goodwill stretching from Turkey to 123 countries.

                            IHH is providing aid to earthquake victims through search and rescue operations, delivery of

                            setting up soup kitchens, aid distribution, health services, and psychological support.
                            Their efforts are crucial in helping the victims recover from the disaster.
