                            Earthquake Relief is a collective that exists to connect you with numerous NGOs
                            that actively offer relief to victims in Turkey and Syria where two powerful earthquakes in
                            quick succession have resulted
                            in devastating consequences and have claimed the lives of over 37,000 people and left nearly
                            100,000 injured.
                            Urgent assistance is needed to provide relief to survivors, including many children and
                            babies, who are stranded in harsh winter conditions
                            We focus on this so you can be pointed in the right direction having felt compelled
                            to give towards their relief efforts.

                    18th century.<br>
                    They form a huge community of ordinary people, a lot of them volunteers, that share a vision and

                            IHH has been working since 1992 with the purpose of delivering aid to all people who are in
                            need,
                            who have experienced a catastrophe, who are victims of war, natural disaster, etc. or
                            wounded, crippled, starved,
                            homeless and persecuted, wherever they are, regardless of their religion, language, race or
                            sect, and to prevent the violation of the basic
                            human rights and freedoms of those people.
                            IHH's voluntary relief activities evolved into an official organization in 1995 and spread
                            around five continents
                            as it established a bridge of goodwill stretching from Turkey to 123 countries.

                        <p>
                            IHH is providing aid to earthquake victims through search and rescue operations, delivery of

                            setting up soup kitchens, aid distribution, health services, and psychological support.
                            Their efforts are crucial in helping the victims recover from the disaster.
