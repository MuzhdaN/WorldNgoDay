# **Earthquake Relief**

In preparation for World NGO Day, Earthquake Relief pays tribute to some of the many organizations that are helping and comforting the victims of the recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.

The human and economic efforts of these organizations leave a positive impact on the lives of those who are somehow involved with them.

Earthquake Relief adds to that effort by presenting the user with an overview of the contribution of NGOs in daily life, it focuses on the aid currently being provided in Turkey and Syria and leaves the user the opportunity to join that help through donations.
The NGOs present in our application were chosen at random and with the sole purpose of celebrating their global impact in a general way.

Let's celebrate supporting NGOs!

## **Testing**

### Links

All internal and external links have been tested and work correctly.

### Markup validator

After the validation of the index.html at the official W3 Markup Validator [Markup validator](https://validator.w3.org/), there were:
- 3 errors
- 1 warning
- 9 info statements

All of these points were addressed and the index.html was passed again for validation resulting in all errors and info statements being solved.
The warning remains, but it can't be solved following the suggestion given by the Markup validator.

![This is the result of the markup validator](/assets/images/markup-result.png)

The required div tags for this section are already in place and there isn't any need to use an h1-h2 tag.

### CSS validator

The style provided through the style.css file passed the validation at the official W3 validator Service at [W3 validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en)
